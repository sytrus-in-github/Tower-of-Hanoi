# Tower-of-Hanoi

Implementation in Pascal of the Classic game "tower of Hanoi". 

This is the first serious project that I have done since I started to learn programming years ago. The code is mainly of sentimental value to me :)

The code uses library from Turbo Pascal. To compile and run this code you probably need to install Turbo Pascal and also DOS emulator like DOSBox for systems older than WinXP x86.

Enjoy!
